"""Pyxie is a CSS sprite generator written in python using PIL_.  It generates
both the sprite images and the supporting styles.  It supports a number
of packing strategies in order to accomodate both image-replacement and
background (x-repeat, y-repeat, and corner) image consolidation.  It can output
styles as CSS classes or as Sass_ mixins.  Pyxie is can run standalone or as a
shell interpreter.
